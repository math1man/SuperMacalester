# This file should contain a bunch of short, random dialogues and options
# usable with random NPCs throughout the world.
#
# Dialogues should be formatted as follows:
# <dialogue:[Name]>
# [Content]
# </dialogue>
#
# In order to break apart separate windows of dialogue, use the <d> symbol.
# Newline characters can be used in dialogue, but keep in mind that currently
# only three lines are allowed in a dialogue window, so after three lines use
# a <d> to denote a new window.
#
# Options should be formatted as follows:
#
# <options:[Name]>
# [Content]
# </options>
#
# The options header and each option should be separated by a new line.
# No more than 10 options can be displayed in the dialogue window.
#
# Dialogue and options that share the same name will be parsed together.

Hi! My name is Paul and I like to code things. I have decided I am going to work at a startup in Minneapolis this summer.

I spent this past summer here working for Libby Shoop designing a website.
