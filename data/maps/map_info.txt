Map info:
Each map should be in its own text file, named exactly after the map. A map is
composed of one or more grids separated by a <floor> command. For grids with
multiple floors, the first floor index should be specified as <first floor:#>
as the first line of the document. Grids are tab-separated values, where each
value is a tile code. Tile codes should start with the tile key followed by a
hyphen and then any flags. Tiles with sprites that take up multiple grid spaces
should be coded in the upper left corner of the area, with the rest of the area
filled with null tiles. An underscore is a prefix for buildings, which are
necessarily impassable and do not need to be flagged as such.

List of terrain tile keys:
      = null tile
  g   = grass
  bh  = bush horizontal
  bv  = bush vertical
  bfh = flowering bush horizontal
  bfv = flowering bush vertical
  ts  = tree small
  tb = tree big
  c   = cobble
  cr  = red cobble
  a   = asphalt
  ah  = asphalt with a horizontal road line
  av  = asphalt with a vertical road line
  an  = asphalt north edge
  ae  = asphalt east edge
  as  = asphalt south edge
  aw  = asphalt west edge
  ane = asphalt northeast corner
  ase = asphalt southeast corner
  ase = asphalt southwest corner
  anw = asphalt northwest corner
