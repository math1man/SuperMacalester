        <d>IN THE YEAR 187X, A PRIVATE LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGE NAMED MACALESTER WAS CREATED. DEWITT WALLACE, THE FIRST LEADER OF THAT BRAVE NEW COLLEGE, SET A STANDARD FOR FIGHTING FOR THE GOOD OF HIS PEOPLE.

        TIMES ARE NOT AS THEY ONCE WERE.

        THE NEW LEADER, BRIAN ROSENBERG, ALSO ONCE STOOD FOR THE GOOD OF OTHERS.
        <d>HOWEVER, YEARS OF FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT HAVE TAKEN THEIR TOLL. THE GOOD PRESIDENT HAS BECOME OBSESSED WITH TRYING TO SOLVE THE WORLD'S PROBLEMS BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY, WITH NO REGARD FOR HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS. THUS WERE THE SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS BORN: AN ELITE FORCE CREATED TO MAINTAIN A STATE OF EQUAL PRIVILEGE. NOW, ANYONE WHO TRIES TO POINT OUT ROSENBERG'S SHORTSIGHTEDNESS IS BRANDED AN ENEMY OF THE STATE, AND FEW STILL STAND TO RESIST HIS DELUDED TOTALITARIAN REGIME."
