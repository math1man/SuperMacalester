                            <d>Baal: That there is a power-up. Take that to make yourself stronger in battle.
                            <d>Baal: You’ll also get stronger from the experience of battling a lot. You’ll figure it out. It’s a mediocre RPG, not rocket science.
                            <d>Baal: Anyway, I’ll stick around in the meantime. Looks like you could use my help. We should probably start looking for clues
                            <d>Baal: as to how we can stop all of this madness from happening. The Campus Center is probably a good place to start looking."
