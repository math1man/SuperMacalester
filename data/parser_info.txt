Data for this project is parsed using JSON, but with specific structures.
In the following examples, items in angle brackets <> are variable.
Anything not in angle brackets must be written exactly as is.

A sample entity:

"<Entity Name>" : {
    TODO: figure out how to parse Entities
}

A sample location:

"<Location Name>" : {
    "grid" : "<world for world map, or building name and floor number, separated by a non-word character>",
    "x" : <x coordinate>,
    "y" : <y coordinate>,
    "direction" : <north, east, south, or west>
}

A sample interaction:

"<Interaction Name>" : {
    TODO: figure out how to parse Interactions
}

A sample goal:

"<Goal Name>" : {
    "entity" : { <the entity> },
    "location" : { <the location> },
    "interaction" : { <the interaction> }
}

A sample quest:

"<Quest Name>" : {
    "id" : <unique identifier (int)>
    "goals" : [ <array of goals> ],
}

A sample dialogue:

"<Dialogue Name>" : {
    "dialogue" : "<string of dialogue goes here>",
    "interaction" : {
        <interaction>
    },
    "options" : {
        "header" : "<option header goes here>",
        "options" : [
            "<option 1>",
            "<option 2>",
            <etc>
        ],
        "interactions" : [
            { <first interaction> },
            { <second interaction> },
            <etc>
        ]
    }
}

Dialogue may be specified in 4 ways:
  - dialogue string only
  - dialogue string plus interaction
  - dialogue options only
  - dialogue string plus options
Additionally, the dialogue options interactions are optional, though if present,
they must match the amount of options given. Dialogue windows should be separated
by <d>, as the newline "\n" character is usable in dialogue windows.
