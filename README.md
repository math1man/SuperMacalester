SuperMacalester
===============

Okay, this time it's for real.  Everything is up and running I think.

When you set up the project, I recommend putting it in a superfolder within your project directory to group all five modules.

In order to find the missing projects and actually run anything, download the missing modules from the following link and save them in the same directory as the primary module.

In order to run the program, you can either open up the SuperMacalester-desktop directory and run the Main class main method.  This will run the program as a java class on your computer.  Alternatively, you can run the MainActivity in the SuperMacalester-android as an Android program.  The latter of course requires a device or emulator.

Any external resources (images, animations, and sounds) should be placed in the data folder in the primary project, though they may need to be placed in the appropriate folder in the other modules (assets in android, bin/data in desktop).
