SuperMacalester
===============

Okay, this time it's for real.  Everything is up and running I think.

In order to actually run anything and find the missing projects, download the missing modules here:

In order to run the program, you can either open up the SuperMacalester-desktop directory and run the Main class main method.  This will run the program as a java class on your computer.  Alternatively, you can run the MainActivity in the SuperMacalester-android as an Android program.  The latter of course requires a device or emulator.
